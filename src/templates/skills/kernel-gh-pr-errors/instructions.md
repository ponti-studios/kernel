# GH PR Errors

## When to Use

- The user wants the latest GitHub Actions errors for the current branch.
- The user asks why the open pull request is failing in CI.
- You need the failed step logs from the most recent pull request workflow run.

## Workflow

1. Run `.claude/skills/kernel-gh-pr-errors/scripts/check-last-gh-actions-errors.sh` from the repo root.
2. If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user exactly what is missing.
3. If the current branch has no open pull request, stop and report that.
4. If no pull request workflow runs exist yet, stop and report that.
5. Surface the PR URL, branch pair, workflow name, status, conclusion, commit, and start time.
6. If the latest run is still in progress, tell the user there are no completed errors yet.
7. If the latest run succeeded, say that clearly.
8. If the latest run failed, summarize the failed logs and call out the first actionable error.

## Notes

- Prefer the bundled script over reimplementing the `gh` query flow in ad hoc shell.
- Fall back from `gh run view --log-failed` to `gh run view --log` when GitHub cannot scope failed logs.
