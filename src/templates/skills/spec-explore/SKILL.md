Explore context, tradeoffs, and risks inside a Linear issue or project using Linear MCP.

## Steps

### 1. Verify and orient
- Confirm Linear MCP is available (check for `linear_*` tools).
- Use `mcp_linear_get_issue` (+ `includeRelations: true`) on the target issue or project to read its current description, acceptance criteria, and relations.
- Read all sub-issues with `mcp_linear_list_issues` (filtered by `parentId`) to understand the full scope.

### 2. Map the unknowns
Identify every open question in the issue:
- **Decision gaps** — questions that must be answered before implementation can start.
- **Dependency unknowns** — unclear whether an upstream change or API is ready.
- **Scope ambiguity** — the issue description doesn't fully define what "done" looks like.
- **Risk areas** — portions of the design with a high chance of failure or rework.

### 3. Investigate
For each unknown identified in step 2:
- Search the codebase for relevant context (existing patterns, related code, prior attempts).
- Read related Linear issues with `mcp_linear_get_issue` to understand decisions already made.
- Reason about tradeoffs — name at least two options and the consequences of each.

### 4. Write findings back to Linear
- Use `mcp_linear_save_issue` to update the issue or project description with:
  - Resolved decisions and their rationale.
  - Outstanding decisions requiring human input (each as a named open question).
  - Any missing or incomplete acceptance criteria.
- Use `mcp_linear_save_comment` to summarise the exploration and confirm it is complete.

### 5. Report
- State which questions were resolved and which remain open.
- Give a clear recommendation: is the issue ready for `jinn-apply`, or does it need a decision first?

## Guardrails
- Always use Linear MCP tools — never manage context externally.
- Do not start implementation during explore — this skill produces decisions, not code.
- Never mark a question resolved without concrete rationale written into the issue.
- Keep recommendations grounded in both codebase evidence and Linear context.
