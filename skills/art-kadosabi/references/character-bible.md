# character design & world style guide

1920s meets future. hand-drawn characters in a sleek CGI world.

## the core conflict

characters are ink. hand-drawn 1930s animation style. wet outlines, vibrating at 24fps.

the world is glass and steel. art deco 2125. sharp, clean, jewel-toned. zero grain.

that's the whole visual language. organic stuff = old cartoon rules. built stuff = crisp future architecture.

## character physics

**line weight:** outlines are 4px, variable. internal details are 2px. they wiggle between frames (line boil).

**grain:** film damage overlay applied only to characters. makes them feel even more analog.

**halftone shading:** 45-degree dot patterns for depth.

**elasticity:** limbs get thinner when they stretch (volume conservation). the "50/150 rule"—compress 50% on landing, stretch 150% on reach.

## the characters

**wyatt bose (protagonist)**
- head is a rigid cardboard box. 15-degree tilt, locked.
- has a dent from shipping.
- huge vertical oval eyes, pie-cut top-right.
- black hoodie with bell sleeves. white marshmallow sneakers.

**benny bounce (best friend)**
- soft oval head. button nose. chipped tooth.
- cropped graphic tee over a long open button-up.
- parachute cargo pants with extra jiggle physics on pockets.
- constant bouncy 24fps pulsing. secondary motion in everything he wears.

**lola lumina (lead)**
- "ink-dipped elegance." 1930s femme fatale meets 1990s NYC goth.
- sharp angular ink-portrait face. jawline for days.
- large vertical oval eyes with the pie-cut (45-degree wedge top-right). heavy ink-black lashes, staring-through-you vibe.
- massive voluminous black hair in thick ribbons. white halftone gloss on the wave peaks for shine. moves as one mass with extreme drag—stays in the air 3 frames after she stops.
- floor-length white collarless duster coat that stays perfectly vertical. dark cropped turtleneck underneath, midriff exposed. high-waisted flared trousers. chunky platform Chelsea boots.
- animated "on twos" (12fps strict). she drifts and glides. the duster coat has zero-gravity physics.

**lucy (the colorist)**
- wide flattened oval head. brushed ink outline, slightly variable stroke. warm line quality.
- massive coily hair volume, rendered as thick ink-stroke clusters. largest silhouette in the cast.
- warm coral-orange accent: the one color void cannot drain. appears on paint streaks, earrings, and mural fragments only.
- high-waisted wide-leg trousers, oversized graphic jacket hanging open, platform boots. paint streaks rendered as flat color geometry.
- 24fps full. most kinetic character after benny. rubber arms, hard landings, no drift.
- full reference: `lucy.md`

**void (villain)**
- pure black circle head. negative space.
- sucks the color out of the world—fades background colors to gray in a 2-inch radius.
- no stretch, no squash. just slides.

## the world

art deco meets sci-fi. tapering ziggurats. gold trim. vacuum-tube transit. stone structures floating on glowing blue energy beams.

no touchscreens. physical dials. flickering zoetrope holograms.

## sound

**characters:** slide whistles, woodblocks, tinny 1930s jazz.

**world:** THX bass, clean electronic hums, crystal-clear whirs.

## quality checklist

- lola's pupils are vertical ovals with the wedge top-right
- white duster frames her dark silhouette
- lola's hair moves with cohesive drag, stays in air 3 frames after she stops
- lola is locked to 12fps (every-other-frame keyframes)
- wyatt's head stays rigid and isometric
- lucy's hair is the largest silhouette element — never small or restrained
- lucy's coral-orange appears only on paint streaks, earrings, and mural fragments
- lucy lands hard — no drift, no float
- void's gray never drains lucy's coral-orange
