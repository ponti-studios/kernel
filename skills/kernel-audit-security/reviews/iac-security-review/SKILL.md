# IaC Security Review

Review infrastructure-as-code for security risks by following the full procedure in `plays/iac-security-review.md`.

## Steps

1. **Detect IaC Type** — Identify the infrastructure technology from file extensions and content:
   - `.tf` / `.tofu` files → Terraform/OpenTofu (reference `data/secure-code-prompts/terraform.md`)
   - Kubernetes manifests (apiVersion, kind: Deployment/Pod/Service) → Kubernetes (reference `data/secure-code-prompts/kubernetes.md`)
   - CloudFormation templates (AWSTemplateFormatVersion, Resources with AWS::) → CloudFormation (reference `data/secure-code-prompts/cloudformation.md`)
   - Helm charts (`Chart.yaml`, templates/) → Kubernetes review with Helm-specific checks

2. **Systematic Review by Security Domain** (priority order):
   - **Identity & Access Management** — Overly permissive policies, wildcard permissions, hardcoded credentials, privilege escalation paths
   - **Secrets Management** — Hardcoded secrets, plaintext credentials, missing vault/secret manager integration
   - **Network Security** — Open ingress (`0.0.0.0/0`), unrestricted ports, missing segmentation, public exposure
   - **Encryption** — Missing encryption at rest/in transit, weak algorithms, default keys
   - **Storage Security** — Public buckets, unencrypted volumes, missing versioning
   - **Logging & Monitoring** — Missing audit trails, disabled CloudTrail/audit logging
   - **Resource Exposure** — Databases, admin interfaces, APIs exposed to internet
   - **Supply Chain** — Unpinned versions, untrusted sources, unverified modules/images
   - **Platform-Specific Risks** — Terraform state exposure, K8s privileged containers, CFN nested stack integrity

3. **Check Against Benchmarks** — Validate configurations against:
   - CIS Benchmarks (AWS/Azure/GCP/Kubernetes)
   - Cloud provider security best practices
   - Pod Security Standards (for Kubernetes)

4. **Produce Findings** — For each finding: cite resource path, explain the misconfiguration, describe attack scenario, provide fixed code example, rate severity.

## Output

Findings sorted by severity using `templates/finding.md` format, summary with severity counts, and secure configuration improvements section.
