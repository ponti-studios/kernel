## Overview

Some apps embed networking stacks that manage TLS independently from Apple's ATS-enforced URL Loading System. Examples include OpenSSL, BoringSSL, mbedTLS, curl, and gRPC. Since ATS doesn't apply to these libraries, any weak TLS configuration in them is not protected by ATS or `URLSession` settings.

Such libraries often expose their own API calls to set the minimum TLS version, maximum TLS version, cipher suite list, certificate verification mode, or custom trust store. If these settings permit TLS below 1.2, allow deprecated cipher suites, or disable certificate verification, they introduce vulnerabilities that are entirely independent of the ATS configuration.

Apple's documentation states that "ATS doesn't apply to calls your app makes to lower-level networking interfaces like the `Network` framework or `CFNetwork`. In these cases, you take responsibility for ensuring the security of the connection." (See [Preventing Insecure Network Connections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing-insecure-network-connections).) The same principle applies to entirely embedded TLS libraries.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0082 to list the frameworks and libraries bundled in the app (under `Frameworks/` or statically linked into the binary).
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0066 to identify embedded third-party TLS library symbols (for example, `SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version` for OpenSSL/BoringSSL, `mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_version` for mbedTLS, or `curl_easy_setopt` for libcurl).
3. Use @MASTG-TECH-0076 to analyze the code paths where TLS configuration is applied and determine the minimum TLS version, cipher suites, and certificate verification settings in use.

## Observation

The output should contain a list of any identified third-party TLS library functions and their configuration call sites within the app binary.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if any embedded TLS library is configured to:

- Allow TLS versions below 1.2.
- Use weak or deprecated cipher suites.
- Disable certificate verification or use a custom trust store without proper validation.
